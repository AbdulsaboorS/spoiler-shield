# SpoilerShield – Agent Handoff Guide

This file is for **AI coding agents** (and humans) switching into this project. Read it first so handoffs are smooth and you can pick up where the last session left off.

---

## 1. Start Here

| Document | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| **CLAUDE.md** (this file) | Quick orientation, current bugs, handoff checklist |
| **PROJECT_CONTEXT.md** | Full PRD + architecture + change log + how to work on the project |

**Before making changes:** Read `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` fully. Skim the key files listed in PROJECT_CONTEXT.md (Index.tsx, useChat.ts, useEpisodeRecap.ts, spoiler-shield-chat/index.ts).

## 3. Current State (As of Last Session)

- **Deployed:** Backend is Supabase Edge Functions (project ref `dbileyqtnisyqzgwwive`). Frontend hosted on Lovable; local dev via `npm run dev`.
- **LLM:** All LLM calls use **Google Generative AI native API** (`GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY` Supabase secret). Chat/audit: `gemini-3-flash-preview` (streaming). Web recap + sanitize: `gemini-2.0-flash` (non-streaming, supports Search Grounding). All functions self-contained — no shared module imports.
- **Chat:** Working end-to-end for any show. Streams correctly. Works without episode context (model uses general show knowledge). `useChat.ts` parses `candidates[0].content.parts[0].text`.
- **UX:** Chat-first side panel. Panel opens directly to chat — no wizard. Sessions per show+episode; history drawer for switching.
- **Context pipeline:** Four-tier fallback — TVMaze (sanitized) → Fandom (JJK S1) → Gemini web search → model knowledge. All recap text goes through `sanitize-episode-context` before use.
- **Detection:** `background.js` programmatically injects `content.js` on icon click and `tabs.onUpdated` — works on already-open tabs after extension reload.
- **Audit pass:** Deployed but not wired into `useChat.ts` — re-enable after confirming chat stability.

## 4. Rules & Constraints

- Do not add new dependencies without documenting the reason in PROJECT_CONTEXT.md Section 7 (Change Log).
- Do not modify the system prompt in `spoiler-shield-chat` without updating PROJECT_CONTEXT.md Section 3 (Spoiler Policy).
- Do not bypass or weaken the spoiler safety contract, even for testing.
- Do not commit secrets or API keys. `.env.local` must stay in `.gitignore`. Supabase secrets are set via CLI only.
- Do not remove or modify `useRef`-based guards in `Index.tsx` or `useEpisodeRecap.ts` without understanding the infinite-loop history (see PROJECT_CONTEXT.md Change Log).
- If you add debug/instrumentation code, note it in CLAUDE.md Section 6 (Current Bugs) so the next agent knows to remove or keep it.
- When debugging LLM behavior: confirm the browser hits the correct Supabase URL, that `spoiler-shield-chat` is deployed with the latest system prompt, and what `context` text is being sent; compare with Lovable-hosted version if available to spot deployment or prompt drift.

## 5. Smoke Test Checklist

After making changes, run this quick manual check to catch regressions:

1. `npm run dev` starts without errors.
2. Open the Chrome extension side panel on a Crunchyroll episode page — panel opens directly to chat (no wizard).
3. Badge shows detected show + episode. ChatStatusBar shows recap loading, then "Shielding based on SxEy knowledge."
4. Ask a safe question (e.g. "Who is Gojo?") — answer streams back without error.
5. Ask a spoiler-risk question (e.g. "Does Yuji die?") — playful refusal, no spoilers.
6. Navigate to a different show without refreshing — detection re-runs automatically.
7. Open on the Crunchyroll home page — panel shows "Pick something to watch 🍿".
8. Try a show with no TVMaze summary (e.g. Kingdom) — web search recap loads, chat works.
9. No console errors related to `useEffect` loops or missing refs.

## 6. Current Bugs / Open Issues

No active bugs. All previously known issues are resolved.

| Issue | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Chat 500 (Lovable gateway) | Fixed 2026-02-17 |
| 404 on OpenAI-compatible endpoint | Fixed 2026-02-19 (native Gemini API) |
| `gemini-2.0-flash` not available for API key | Fixed 2026-02-21 (switched to `gemini-3-flash-preview`) |
| React hooks violation in Index.tsx | Fixed 2026-02-21 (useCallbacks moved above conditional) |
| 4-step wizard friction | Fixed 2026-02-21 (chat-first UX rewrite) |

---

## 7. Upcoming Work (Prioritized)

1. **Re-enable audit pass** – Wire `audit-answer` in `useChat.ts` after streaming; show "Safety edit applied" when answer is modified. Remove the empty-context 400 guard in `audit-answer/index.ts` first (same fix applied to chat on 2026-02-23).
2. **Detection robustness** – More reliable DOM/URL detection across Crunchyroll/Netflix layout updates.
3. **Polish StatusBadge popover** – Show names truncate at 18 chars in badge; full name visible in popover.
4. **`needs-episode` with no showId** – If TVMaze lookup fails entirely, `EpisodePicker` can't render (requires showId). Fallback: show manual season/episode text inputs.

---

## 8. Handoff Checklist (When You Pause)

When you stop and hand off to another agent or return later:

- [ ] **PROJECT_CONTEXT.md** – Section 7 (Change Log) updated with what you did this session.
- [ ] **PROJECT_CONTEXT.md** – Section 6 (Known Limitations) and Section 4/5 updated if you changed behavior or env.
- [ ] **CLAUDE.md** – Section 6 (Current Bugs) and Section 7 (Upcoming Work) updated if you fixed a bug or reprioritized.
- [ ] No **secrets** in repo (`.env.local` in `.gitignore`; secrets only in Supabase dashboard).
- [ ] If you added debug/instrumentation, note it in PROJECT_CONTEXT or CLAUDE.md so the next agent knows to remove or keep it.
